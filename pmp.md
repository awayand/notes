# Time Management

Calculate the effect of changes -> Monte Carlo analysis
Three-Point Estimate: Optimistic, Pessimistic, Most Likely

### Resource Optimization
- Resource Leveling - lengthen schedule and increase cost to deal with resource constraints.
- Resource Smoothing - level resource only within float, no delay in completion dates.

### Critical Chain Method
Use network diagram and critical path and assign each activity to occur as late as possible and still meet the end date. Build buffers for resource limitations at critical milestones, then manage these buffers.

### Project Schedule
* Network Diagram
* Milestone Chart
* Bar Chart

### Schedule Baseline

## Control Schedule
> Problems are prevented through Risk Management

??? Beta Standard Deviation = (P - O)/6

## Plan Quality Management
301

- Cost-Benefit Analysis
- Cost of Quality (COQ)

### Seven Basic Quality Tools

- Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone, Ishikawa)
- Flowchart (Process Map, e.g. **S**upplier**I**nput**P**rocess**O**utput**C**ustomer)
- Checksheet (Tally Sheet)
- Pareto Diagram (Pareto Chart, e.g. which root causes result in most problems)
- Histogram

305

- Control Chart
	- Upper and Lower Control Limits
	- Mean (Average)
	- Specification Limits (customer expectations, outside upper- and lower control limits)
	- Out of Control (i.e. lack of consistency and predictability in process or results)
	- Rule of Seven (General rule/heuristic: within control limits, but not random, so out of control!)
	- Assignable Cause/Special Cause Variation (i.e. data point(s) outside control limits, so out of control!)

308

- Scatter Diagram (Correlation Chart)

309

### Other Quality Tools

- Benchmarking
- Design of Experiments (DOE)
- Statistical Sampling

310

### 3 or 6 Sigma

Sigma aka Standard Deviation indicates how much variance from mean is ok.

	1 Sigma/Standard Deviation = 68.27%
	3 Sigma/Standard Deviations = 99.73%
	6 Sigma/Standard Deviations = 99.9999998%

## Perform Quality Assurance
Tools:

- Plan Quality Management and Control Quality Tools and Techniques
- Quality Audits
- Process Analysis

Other Tools:

- Affinity Diagrams (e.g. organize and group results of a root cause analysis)
- Tree Diagrams (e.g. organize data, relationships)
- Process Decision Program Charts PDPC (used with tree diagrams, decompose goal into steps reviewed for risk)
- Interrelationship Digraph (analyze relationships between issues)
- Matrix Diagrams (visual representation of 2 or more sets of items)
	- Prioritization Matrices
- Project Schedule Network Diagrams or Activity Network Diagrams

313

## Control Quality

314

- Mutual Exclusivity
- Probability
- Normal Distribution (measure variations)
- Statistical Independence (the probability of one event occurring does not affect the probability of another event occurring)
- Standard Deviation/Sigma

		- provides info regarding initial scope
		- gives the project manager authority
		- guides process to get project approved and formalized
	- During Planning:
		- approves final project management plan
	- During Executing/Monitoring/Controlling:
		- resolves conflicts beyond project manager's control
	- During Closing:
		- provides formal acceptance of deliverables, if customer
- Team
	- Create WBS
	- Provide time and cost estimates
- Stakeholder
	
	Involved in:
	- risk management
	- project management plan development

- Functional Manager (manages and owns resources)
	- approve final schedule during schedule development

- Project Manager (responsible for managing the project to meet its objectives)
