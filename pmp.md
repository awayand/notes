# Time Management

Calculate the effect of changes -> Monte Carlo analysis
Three-Point Estimate: Optimistic, Pessimistic, Most Likely

### Resource Optimization
- Resource Leveling - lengthen schedule and increase cost to deal with resource constraints.
- Resource Smoothing - level resource only within float, no delay in completion dates.

### Critical Chain Method
Use network diagram and critical path and assign each activity to occur as late as possible and still meet the end date. Build buffers for resource limitations at critical milestones, then manage these buffers.

### Seven Basic Quality Tools

- Cause and Effect Diagram (Fishbone, Ishikawa)
- Flowchart (Process Map, e.g. **S**upplier**I**nput**P**rocess**O**utput**C**ustomer)
- Checksheet (Tally Sheet)
- Pareto Diagram (Pareto Chart, e.g. which root causes result in most problems)
- Histogram

305

- Control Chart
	- Upper and Lower Control Limits
	- Mean (Average)
	- Specification Limits (customer expectations, outside upper- and lower control limits)
	- Out of Control (i.e. lack of consistency and predictability in process or results)
	- Rule of Seven (General rule/heuristic: within control limits, but not random, so out of control!)
	- Assignable Cause/Special Cause Variation (i.e. data point(s) outside control limits, so out of control!)

308

- Scatter Diagram (Correlation Chart)

309

### Other Quality Tools

- Benchmarking
- Design of Experiments (DOE)
- Statistical Sampling

310

### 3 or 6 Sigma

Sigma aka Standard Deviation indicates how much variance from mean is ok.

	1 Sigma/Standard Deviation = 68.27%
	3 Sigma/Standard Deviations = 99.73%
	6 Sigma/Standard Deviations = 99.9999998%

311

## Perform Quality Assurance
Tools:

- Plan Quality Management and Control Quality Tools and Techniques
- Quality Audits
- Process Analysis

Other Tools:

- Affinity Diagrams (e.g. organize and group results of a root cause analysis)
- Tree Diagrams (e.g. organize data, relationships)
- Process Decision Program Charts PDPC (used with tree diagrams, decompose goal into steps reviewed for risk)
- Interrelationship Digraph (analyze relationships between issues)
- Matrix Diagrams (visual representation of 2 or more sets of items)
	- Prioritization Matrices
- Project Schedule Network Diagrams or Activity Network Diagrams

313

## Control Quality

314

- Mutual Exclusivity
- Probability
- Normal Distribution (measure variations)
- Statistical Independence (the probability of one event occurring does not affect the probability of another event occurring)
- Standard Deviation/Sigma

# Human Resource Management
## Roles and Responsibilities
- Sponsor (approves changes to the project charter)
	- During Initiating:
		- provides financial resources
		- if customer, some tasks taken by Senior Management
		- provides project statement of work
		- provides info regarding initial scope
		- gives the project manager authority
		- guides process to get project approved and formalized
	- During Planning:
		- approves final project management plan
	- During Executing/Monitoring/Controlling:
		- resolves conflicts beyond project manager's control
	- During Closing:
		- provides formal acceptance of deliverables, if customer
- Team
	- Create WBS
	- Provide time and cost estimates
- Stakeholder
	
	Involved in:
	- risk management
	- project management plan development

- Functional Manager (manages and owns resources)
	- approve final schedule during schedule development

- Project Manager (responsible for managing the project to meet its objectives)
	- can get help from additional member to do the work

- Portfolio Manager (responsible for governance of projects/programs in portfolio)
	- manages a group of related projects

Conflict Resolution Techniques

- Collaborating (Problem Solving) - win-win
- Compromising (Reconciling) - lose-lose
- Withdrawal (Avoidance) - not the best
- Smoothing (Accommodating)
- Forcing (Directing) - win-lose

		- Self-actualization
		- Esteem
		- Social
		- Safety

# Communications Management

Communications channels = (N* (N-1)) / 2
N = number of people

392

## Performance Reporting

Includes cost, schedule, scope and quality performance

393

- Status Report
- Progress Report
- Trend Report
- Forecasting Report
- Variance Report
- Earned Value Report
- Lessons Learned Documentation

## Control Communications
Communications is 90% of the PM's time

# Risk Management

- Risks are identified and managed started in Initiating!
- Investigation of uncertainties may help identify risks.

## Risk Factors
- how likely
- impact or amount at stake
- when
- how often

## Risk Appetite, Tolerance, Threshold
Level of risk that is willing to be accepted
Risk appetite: acceptable level of risk (e.g. schedule delay)
Risk tolerance: measurable (e.g. up to 14 days)
Threshold: specific point where risk becomes unacceptable (e.g. 15 days)
416

- Risk sources and risk categories are used interchangeably

## Types of Risk
- Business Risk (gain or loss)
- Pure (insurable) Risk (loss, e.g. fire, theft, personal injury, etc.)
418
## Risk Identification Tools and Techniques
- Documentation Reviews (what is and isn't documented, lessons learned, etc.)
- Information-Gathering Techniques
	- Brainstorming
	- Delphi Technique (group of experts' reviews compiled and fed back until consensus)
	- Interviewing
	- RCA
- **S**trengths**W**eaknesses**O**pportunities**T**hreats (SWOT) Analysis
- Checklist Analysis
- Assumptions Analysis
- Diagramming Techniques

- Updated Risk Register is chief item under "project documents updates".

## Qualitative Risk Analysis
probability of risk occurring and impact
Tools:
- Porbability and Impact Matrix
- Risk Data Quality Assessment
- Risk Categorization/Sources of risk by cause
- Risk Urgency Assessment

## Quantitative Risk Analysis (x422x)
### Sensitivity Analysis
- compare potential impacts of risks (Tornado diagram)
### Exepected monetary value analysis
- EMV = **P**robability x **I**mpact
### Monte Carlo Analysis (Simulation Technique)
- uses network diagram and estimates to perform the project many times and simulate cost or schedule.
### Decision Trees

x428x

## Risk Response Strategies (aka Risk Mitigation Strategies)
for Threats:
- Avoid (for high priority, high impact risks)
- Mitigate (for high priority, high impact risks)
- Transfer (Deflect, Allocate) (for low priority, low-impact risks)
for Opportunities:
- Exploit (opposite of avoid)
- Enhance (opposite of mitigate)
- Share
for Threats AND Opportunities:
- Accept (must be communicated to stakeholders)

431
- Residual Risks: remaining risks after risk response planning.

438
## Control Risk
e.g.:
- Workarounds: unplanned responses (vs. contingency response)
- Risk Reassessments
- Risk Audits (documented in the Risk Management Plan)
- Reserve Analysis
